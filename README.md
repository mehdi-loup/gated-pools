GatedPools lets DAOs spin up permissioned Uniswap V4 pools that only verified members can access via vLayer ZK proofs created from approved email domain. DAO contributors trade with 0 bps fees and built-in MEV resistance, while the DAO treasury runs its own arbitrage to guarantee the best prices for their organization.

Real-World Example: suppose a DAO pays 2 million $DAO monthly to contributors. By launching a GatedPool (ZK authorizing @dao.org, pairing $DAO/USDC at 0 bps), 100 contributors would swap their tokens fee-free at 4 USDC each—saving ~6,000 $DAO (~24,000 USDC) in fees—while DAO’s treasury arb bot would capture an extra 15,000 USDC in spreads.
